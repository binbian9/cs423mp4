The authors describe a few categorized metrics for evaluating our performance during the course. They suggest a scheme based on using a score from the range $1$ -- $5$. Of course, this is somewhat subjective. This scheme is opposed to a ``subconscious error correction'' technique proposed by Gallwey in \cite{gallwey1997the}, but I feel it could generally be useful in giving some feedback.

The appendix tends to differentiate ``instructional goals'' from ``personal goals,'' but this distinction seems artificial. Ideally, the instructional goals should help in providing some honest and impartial feedback that the appendix covers.

A large proportion of this self-assessment guide isn't very class-specific, e.g. being organized, participating in class, understanding the focus, etc.. The few evaluations that could be useful those outlined in the \textit{technique evaluation} and \textit{movement} sections. Otherwise, the advice given is way too generic to help in improving dance technique. Furthermore, trying to use the scoring scheme for \textit{everything} discussed in the appendix seems excessive.
